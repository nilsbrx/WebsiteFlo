## Quantum Many-Body Physics and Quantum Computing Research at Bielefeld University

[We](https://www.physik.uni-bielefeld.de/~crobin/) are working on the development of methods for solving the quantum many-body problem, in order to describe the structure and dynamics of strongly-interacting systems, in particular atomic nuclei.

We are particularly interested in studying the role of entanglement in nuclear structure and nuclear processes, and in the development of entanglement-driven methods and algorithms for classical and quantum simulations of nuclei.

## Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei

Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the quantum complexity of p-shell and sd-shell nuclei.

## Financial hidden Markov models

I am interested in modeling financial data with hidden Markov models (HMMs) - a versatile class of statistical models for time series data that is assumed to be dependent on latent states. In case of financial data, the latent states can be interpreted as different moods of the market. Even though these moods cannot be observed directly, price changes - which clearly depend on the current mood of the market - can be observed. Thereby, using an underlying Markov process, we can detect which mood is active at any point in time and how the different moods alternate. Depending on the current mood, a price change is generated by a different distribution. These distribution
